qe-util
=======

Set of utilities for using Quantum-Espresso with ASE and ipython notebooks.
Modelled after recommended ASE FileIOCalculator. Part of this code is derived 
from the [ASE interface fo QE](http://qe-forge.org/gf/project/ase_qe_intrfce/) 
written by [Luca Tornatore](http://qe-forge.org/gf/user/tornatore/).

Installation
------------

Since the package is an extension to ASE you need to install 
this library first. Go to the ASE website for instructions.

The best way to install the release of qeutil is to use pip 
(possibly in virtualenv):

        pip install qeutil
